Project Overview
    Our project creates a user interface to display different properties in Pakistan in both a data table and map, based on the selected criteria: city, property type, number of     bathrooms, and number of bedrooms. The table displays all of this information, along with the property ID, longitude, and latitude of each property. The map displays the         abundance of peoperties in each area of the selected locations, color coded by price. The user can then select to sort the data in the table using either Quick Sort or Merge     Sort, in ascending or descending order.

Instructions
    After forking the repository and downloading associated packages, navigate to app.py and run the file. From there, click on the locally hosted link that prints in the terminal. You will then be able to interact with the interface!
